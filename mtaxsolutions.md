## M Tax Solutions

M Tax solutions is a new tax preparation service with a long legacy.  We provide personal service that takes the time to understand your particular tax circumstance.  Feel free to ask around about us.  We love our clients and they love us.

If you enjoy having your taxes prepared by robots there are plenty of Mega Big Inc. Tax firms to choose from.  But if you want someone who will give you personal service that will work with you M Tax Solutions is your tax solution.

If you use the link we will send you an email confirming your appointment.  It will even put it on your calendar if you have one of those smart phones.  And you can easily change your appointment online.

As a modern tax service, we can work with you to do your taxes over the in person, over the phone or over FaceTime or other video conferencing.  We understand you are very busy.  So you don't have to see us in person.  But we don't mind if you do.
